# AI Script
A simple illustrator script

This is a script for adobe illustrator to automate the drawing of items. 

This particular script draws a customizable number of labels comprised of a bounding box, a serialized text label, and a matching serialized QR code for scanning.

The script outputs all of these items onto a single artboard.

Use case for this had the next steps being to bring this to a vinyl cutter which printed and cut out the labels corresponding to the CMYK color in the label bounding boxes.
It worked very well and we printed over 1500 labels.
